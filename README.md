# Digital Signals Processing Exercises
Multiple exercises regarding digital signals processing (audio and images)

## 1. Low-level audio classification
Implementation of the Zero-Crossing Rate (ZCR) feature to describe a single-channel audio signal

## 2. Frequency-based audio analysis
Implementation of three distinct feature extractors based respectively on Spectrogram, Mel Spectrogram, and MFCC

## 3. Low-level image processing
Experiments with the compression of a color image by blurring the channels of the YCbCr representation

## 4. Photo stitching
Implementation of a script for stitching two images
